## 📋 Overview

This document details the implementation of Tasks 8 and 9 for the Personal Finance Tracker project:
- **Task 8**: Monthly Budget Setting
- **Task 9**: Budget Progress Visualization

## 🎯 Task 8: Monthly Budget Setting

### Purpose
Allow users to set monthly spending limits for different expense categories to help them control their spending.

### Features Implemented
1. **Budget Creation**: Users can set a budget amount for any expense category
2. **Budget Modification**: Existing budgets can be updated with new amounts
3. **Budget Deletion**: Users can remove budgets they no longer need
4. **Monthly Isolation**: Budgets are specific to each month
5. **Category-Based**: Each budget is tied to a specific spending category

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE budgets (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    month TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id),
    UNIQUE(user_id, category, month)
)
```

### Key Functions
```python
# Route to display budget form
@app.route('/budget')
def budget():
    # Shows current month's budgets
    # Displays form to add/edit budgets

# Route to process budget creation/update
@app.route('/add_budget', methods=['POST'])
def add_budget():
    # Validates input
    # Checks for existing budget
    # Updates or creates new budget

# Route to delete budget
@app.route('/delete_budget/<int:budget_id>')
def delete_budget(budget_id):
    # Removes budget from database
```

### User Interface
- **Budget Dashboard**: Shows all budgets for current month
- **Add Budget Form**: Dropdown for category selection, input for amount
- **Edit Budget**: Modify existing budget amounts
- **Delete Option**: Remove unwanted budgets

## 📊 Task 9: Budget Progress Visualization

### Purpose
Provide visual feedback showing how much of each budget has been spent, using color-coded progress bars.

### Features Implemented
1. **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of spending vs budget
2. **Color Coding**: 
   - Green (0-50%): Safe spending zone
   - Yellow (51-80%): Caution zone
   - Orange (81-100%): Warning zone
   - Red (>100%): Over budget alert
3. **Real-time Calculations**: Automatically calculates spending from transactions
4. **Remaining Amount Display**: Shows how much budget is left
5. **Over-budget Alerts**: Warning messages when budget is exceeded

### Progress Calculation Logic
```python
# Calculate spending for each budget category
for budget in budgets:
    spent = sum_of_transactions(category, current_month)
    percentage = (spent / budget_amount) * 100
    remaining = budget_amount - spent
    
    # Determine color based on percentage
    if percentage <= 50:
        color = 'green'
    elif percentage <= 80:
        color = 'yellow'
    elif percentage <= 100:
        color = 'orange'
    else:
        color = 'red'
```

### Visual Elements
- **Progress Bar Container**: Gray background showing total budget
- **Filled Progress Bar**: Colored portion showing spending
- **Percentage Display**: Numerical percentage inside bar
- **Status Indicators**: Text labels (On Track, Caution, Warning, Over Budget)
- **Remaining Amount**: Shows dollar amount left in budget

### Key Functions
```python
# Main progress visualization route
@app.route('/budget_progress')
def budget_progress():
    # Get all budgets for current month
    # Calculate spending for each category
    # Determine progress percentage
    # Assign colors based on thresholds
    # Generate progress bars

# API endpoint for single category progress
@app.route('/api/progress/<category>')
def api_budget_progress(category):
    # Returns JSON with progress data
    
# Alert system for over-budget categories
@app.route('/budget_alerts')
def budget_alerts():
    # Returns categories approaching or over limit
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Setting a Budget (Task 8)
1. Navigate to `/budget` or click "Set Budgets"
2. Select a category from dropdown
3. Enter budget amount
4. Click "Set Budget"
5. Budget appears in list below

### Viewing Progress (Task 9)
1. Navigate to `/budget_progress` or click "View Progress"
2. See all budgets with progress bars
3. Colors indicate spending status
4. View remaining amounts
5. See alerts for over-budget categories

---

## 🔄 Integration with Other Tasks

### Dependencies
- **Task 1 (Authentication)**: User ID for budget ownership
- **Task 2 (Database)**: Database structure and connections
- **Tasks 3-7 (Transactions)**: Transaction data for spending calculations

### Data Flow
1. User sets budget (Task 8)
2. User adds expense transactions (Tasks 3-7)
3. System calculates spending from transactions
4. Progress bars display spending vs budget (Task 9)
5. Alerts shown when approaching/exceeding limits

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Planned for Milestone 2.0
1. **Budget Templates**: Save and reuse budget configurations
2. **Historical Comparison**: Compare budgets across months
3. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest budgets based on spending history
4. **Category Groups**: Group related categories (e.g., all food-related)
5. **Notifications**: Email/SMS alerts when approaching limits
6. **Rollover Budgets**: Carry unused budget to next month
7. **Savings Goals**: Link budgets to savings targets
